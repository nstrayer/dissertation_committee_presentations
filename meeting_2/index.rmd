# Paper \#2: Consensus SBM: An uncertainty-aware network clustering method



.side-bullet.big-left.topics[
SBMs

- Cluster network data
- Flexible in format ({bi, tri, ...}-partite networks)
- Interpretable
]


.side-bullet.big-left.topics.nopad[
### +
]

.side-bullet.big-left.topics[
### Consensus Clustering

- Recognizes that many clusterings may fit data
- Reduce data to pairwise "probability of being in same cluster" distances
]



.side-bullet.big-left.topics.nopad[
### =
]



.side-bullet.big-left.topics[
### C-SBM
- Use posterior to quickly sample lots of potential partitionings
- Consensus clustering provides window to view super high-dimensional results
]

## Performance on simulated data

### [`sbmR` Vignette](http://nickstrayer.me/sbmR/articles/sampling_from_posterior.html)

---

## What does this contribute?


![:space 8]

.side-bullet[
__Statistically principled method of clustering data that defies common probability functions__


_What is the distribution of an entire genome or phenome?_
]

![:space 4]


.side-bullet[
__A new way of looking at the results of bayesian SBMs__

_Previous results either ignored or used summary stats_
]

![:space 4]
  
.side-bullet[
__An easy jumping off point for specialization into more specialized methods__

_Polypartite specialization, Time-dependent, ..._
]


---
class: center, middle

# How can it be expanded?

---

### Polypartite specialization

.side-bullet[
Place restrictions on potential connections

_Can greatly increase the models power to resolve structure_
]

.side-bullet.move-up[
`sbmR` package allows defining complex relationships between nodes

_I am not aware of any other software doing this_
]

### Multiple edge types

.left-side[

![:space 18]

- What if the "network" has different edge types? 

![:space 5]

- E.g. ICD9 counts and protein fold changes

![:space 5]

- SBM fitting protocols could be modified to deal with this
]

.right-side[
![:centerPic 65](figs/multi_edge_type_sbm.png)
]


---
  
### Time dependence
  
- How do comorbidities or protein pathways change over time?
- Clusters remain the same, edge propensities change. 
- See [Role Detection in Bicycle-Sharing Networks Using Multilayer Stochastic Block Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09440) by Carlen Et Al

## Features beyond consensus SBMs

![:space 13]

.side-bullet.big-left.middle[
[New more efficient agglomerative merging technique](http://nickstrayer.me/sbmR/articles/agglomerative_merging.html)

- Cuts runtime of original algorithm down by roughly a factor of `N`
- Demos of superior performance in package vignettes
]

.side-bullet.big-left.middle[
[Advanced node and edge type specification](http://nickstrayer.me/sbmR/reference/new_sbm_network.html#examples)

- No other package that I am aware of does this
- Enables semi-supervised approaches etc.
